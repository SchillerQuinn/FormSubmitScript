# FormSubmitScript
This project is for a scriplet that will scrape information from a webhelp desk ticket to prefill out a google form.

The user will copy and paste the Bookmarklet.js into a bookmark on the computer. Bookmarklet.js will then load the most recent version of Scraper.js and run it. Scraper.js will find the information on the website, assemble the prefilled URL and then give it to the user to copy.
